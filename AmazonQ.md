# Remote SWE Agents Knowledge Base

This file provides important information about the Remote SWE Assistant repository. AI agent references this to support its work on this project.

## Project Structure

This project consists of the following main components:

1. **CDK (AWS Cloud Development Kit)** - `/cdk` directory
   - Infrastructure provisioning code
   - AWS resource definitions (Lambda, DynamoDB, EC2, etc.)

2. **Slack Bolt App** - `/slack-bolt-app` directory
   - Slack integration interface
   - API for processing user requests

3. **Worker** - `/worker` directory
   - AI agent implementation
   - Tool suite (GitHub operations, file editing, command execution, etc.)

## Coding Conventions

- Use TypeScript to ensure type safety
- Use Promise-based patterns for asynchronous operations
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Prefer function-based implementations over classes

## Commonly Used Commands

### Common

```bash
# Format check
npm run format:check

# Code formatting
npm run format

# Build
npm run build
```

### CDK

```bash
# CDK deployment
cd cdk && npx cdk deploy

# List stacks
cd cdk && npx cdk list

# Check stack differences
cd cdk && npx cdk diff
```

### Worker

```bash
# Local execution
cd worker && npm run start:local

# TypeScript-only build
cd worker && npm run build
```

### Slack Bolt App

```bash
# Run in development mode (watch for changes)
cd slack-bolt-app && npm run dev

# Build
cd slack-bolt-app && npm run build
```

## Development Flow

1. Create a branch for a new feature or bug fix
2. Implement changes and test
3. Run format and type checks
4. Create a PR and ensure CI passes. The PR title should always be in English.
5. Request review when the PR is ready (i.e. when you implemented all the requested features and all the CI passes.)

## Troubleshooting

- **Build errors**: Check that dependencies are up to date (`npm ci` to update)
- **TypeScript errors**: Ensure type definitions are accurate and use type assertions when necessary
